# Its puspose is to store a martix and a cached value of the inverse of the 
# matrix. Contains the following functions:
# * setMatrix      set the value of a matrix
# * getMatrix      get the value of a matrix
# * cacheInverse   get the cahced value (inverse of the matrix)
# * getInverse     get the cahced value (inverse of the matrix)
#
# Notes:
# not sure how the "x = numeric()" part works in the argument list of the 
# function, but it seems to be creating a variable "x" that is not reachable 
# from the global environment, but is available in the environment of the 
# makeCacheMatrix function
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = numeric()) {
  
  # holds the cached value or NULL if nothing is cached
  # initially nothing is cached so set it to NULL
  cache <- NULL
  
  # store a matrix
  setMatrix <- function(newValue) {
    x <<- newValue
    # since the matrix is assigned a new value, flush the cache
    cache <<- NULL
  }
  
  # returns the stored matrix
  getMatrix <- function() {
    x
  }
  
  # cache the given argument 
  cacheInverse <- function(solve) {
    cache <<- solve
  }
  
  # get the cached value
  getInverse <- function() {
    cache
  }
  
  # return a list. Each named element of the list is a function
  list(setMatrix = setMatrix, getMatrix = getMatrix, cacheInverse = cacheInverse, getInverse = getInverse)
